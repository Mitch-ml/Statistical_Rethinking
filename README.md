# Statistical_Rethinking
These are my answers to the end of chapter exercises in Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath.  
  
I haven't had anyone check my work, so if you find any errors please let me know!


# Additional resources
Below is a list of solution sets that have been posted by other people who have worked through the book. Trying to do self study is difficult, so I find that having alternative resources to look at is helpful when checking if the problems are done correctly. That being said, remember to always do the problems on your own first before consulting other resources. I urge people to remember the words of Pal Halmos:
> If you absolutely cannot do it, then go home, and think. But for heavens sake, don't look it up in the book. Until you give up. Looking it up in the book is giving up.
