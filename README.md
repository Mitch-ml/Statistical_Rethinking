# Statistical_Rethinking
These are my answers to the end of chapter exercises in Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath.  
  
I haven't had anyone check my work, so if you find any errors please let me know!


# Additional resources
Below are two other solution sets that have been posted. But I urge people to remember the words of Pal Halmos:
